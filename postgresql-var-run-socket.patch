Change the built-in default socket directory to be /var/run/postgresql.
For backwards compatibility with (probably non-libpq-based) clients that
might still expect to find the socket in /tmp, also create a socket in
/tmp.  This is to resolve communication problems with clients operating
under systemd's PrivateTmp environment, which won't be using the same
global /tmp directory as the server; see bug #825448.

Note that we apply the socket directory change at the level of the
hard-wired defaults in the C code, not by just twiddling the setting in
postgresql.conf.sample; this is so that the change will take effect on
server package update, without requiring any existing postgresql.conf
to be updated.  (Of course, a user who dislikes this behavior can still
override it via postgresql.conf.)

This patch must be applied after postgresql-multi-sockets.patch, at
least until 9.3 when that will be part of the upstream package.
